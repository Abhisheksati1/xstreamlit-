1. Find a way to style the motion components, the default style prop provided by
   nextPy does not work because when you pass it to the
   motion component, with some styles(like width and height for example)
   "nextpy" renames that style prop to "sx" in the index.js file
   where that component is created.

2. Try to find a way to pass void functions as props
   add these functions: "https://www.framer.com/motion/component/##animation-events"
